            <p class="about"> Tom Robbins once wrote: I need to babble with a brook or two, inhale starlight,
                make friends with some trees. Hug a Tree helps the 'stadteinsamen' people of Vancouver, BC make friends
                with all sorts of trees and keep track of them. So facebook for people
                and trees? Yes.

            <p class="about">The hugging gang is made up of Curtis Hermanson, Alexis Jensen, Wenny Jiang and Joy Zhao.
                We are undergrads of UBC in the Computer Science department tasked with building a web application for
                our software engineering class. The datasets for this project were provided by the City of Vancouver.
